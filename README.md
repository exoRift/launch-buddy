# LaunchBuddy
LaunchBuddy is a tool to assist with syncing deployments, helping you discretely launch features in unison

LaunchBuddy was built for [Render](https://render.com) projects that deploy from [Github](https://github.com) branches

To get started, build the project with `pnpm build`. If you already have the executable, use `./lb init` to initialize your config.

After your config is set up, use `./lb deploy` to start deploying.
